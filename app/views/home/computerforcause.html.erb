    <h2>IRS Rules for Donating Computer Equipment</h2>
    <p>
      <li>Dhisha takes the guesswork out of the whole Computer Donation process by offering easy to understand and useful information.</li>
      <li>For individuals, the charitable deduction for contributions of technology equals the fair market value (retail used value in the current market place) of the donated property. The donation is tax deductible for the year in which our organization receives the equipment. Shipping costs are also tax deductible under applicable rules and regulations.</li>
      <li>You are eligible for a tax break if you donate computer of electronic gadget to a library, school, or a nonprofit program such as Dhisha. Business donors can deduct the un-depreciated value of the computer, and individuals can deduct the current market value of a computer. </li>
      Example: A computer and related software with a purchase price of $3,000, valued at $1000 at time of contribution, receives a $1000 deduction on Schedule A. A written receipt must be received. The receipt that we provide will have your name on it, the name and identifying number of computers with causes, and the model and type of equipment donated.
